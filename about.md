title: About Me
---

My name is __Ju Han__, it writes like "__鞠焓__" in chinese characters. I'm a engineering student in computer science and also a tech ethutiast. If I'm not busying study, probably you can find me at swimming pool, reading books and interesting blogs or besides my computer for some hacking. I can speak chinese, english and french fluently, so in this blog maybe you will find posts in all these three languages.

### Education ###

Having taken part in an sino-french exchange program
[UTSEUS][1] and obtained a B.S. degree from [Shanghai University][2] in
Infomation Technology within 3 years, I'm currently pursuing the
french engineering diplome (M.A. equivalent) in [University of Technology of
Compiègne][3]. For this time of writing, September 2012, I'm at [EPFL][4]
for a six-month exchange.

My portfolio of knowledge is composed of a wide range of subjects, such as software engineering & programming, web development, data analysis & machine learning, database systems as well as datawarehouse modeling. For the moment, I'm studying functional programming, programming languages & type systems, distributed algorithms and some machine learning applications in EPFL.

Here is my course list.
